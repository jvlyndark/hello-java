# hello-java
A first Hello World project featuring some Java

Hello fellow humanoids!
I'm jvlyndark, fellow non-alien humanoid, and I'm creating my first github repository. 
Inside you'll find the very first java project I wrote for a Comp-Sci course on Object-Oriented Programming at Concordia University! It's intricate but I trust your squishy, humanoid brains (the very same configuration I have installed in my skull cavity) will compute.
More to come!
